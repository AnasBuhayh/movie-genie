# üé¨ Movie Genie Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for **Movie Genie** - an AI-powered movie recommendation system that demonstrates modern ML engineering and full-stack development best practices.

![Movie Genie Architecture](assets/architecture-overview.svg){ align=left width=300 }

**Movie Genie** is a complete movie recommendation system that showcases:

- **üß† Advanced ML Models**: BERT4Rec, Two-Tower, and Semantic Search
- **üåê Full-Stack Integration**: React frontend + Flask backend
- **üîÑ MLOps Pipeline**: DVC-managed data and model workflows
- **üìä Production Ready**: Docker deployment and monitoring

This project serves as both a **functional recommendation system** and a **comprehensive learning reference** for building modern ML applications.
